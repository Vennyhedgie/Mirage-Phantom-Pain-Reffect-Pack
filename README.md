# Mirage-Phantom-Pain-Reffect-Pack
A more visible UI element for Mesmer's Mirage Elite Specialization

Tracks Phantom Pain stacks. This is an optional DPS Mirage trait and I don't consider this pack particularly necessary, but I found use out of it when learning power mirage, so I figured people might like it.

Then right click > Extract here (the necessary files will be added to the packs and icons subfolders).

Then, return to reffect ingame and refresh packs.

Finally, enable / disable whichever interface size and icon set you prefer:
